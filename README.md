# Bretagnizer

In this repository, I implement a Multilayer Perceptron using Pytorch and Numpy. The primary objective was to train this neural network using a dataset comprising village names from my native region, Bretagne, France. The goal was to explore whether a simple neural network could discern and replicate the distinctive phonetic qualities of the local region.
